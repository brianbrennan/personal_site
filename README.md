# Brian Brennan | Web Developer & Designer

This is the repo for my personal site, brianbrennan.com. If you're reading this, you're likely either an employer looking to see my chops, or a fellow developer who's looking to see how I did something or other. 

This site was designed as a brutalist website, whatever exactly that means, to stand out from my competition. Long and repetitive is the list of portfolio sites that make up the web development and desgin community. I wanted to make something that would look differnet among the rest. And by that I mean just follow a different art style rather than sticking to bootstrap alone. 

## How it's made

This site was made using React, SCSS, and love. Why React you might ask? Because it's overkill basically. Plus it looks better when you're applying for React job listings if you have your site done in React, even if it's totally unneccessary
