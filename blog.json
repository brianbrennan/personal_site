If you’re a de­vel­oper like me, you prob­a­bly spend a good por­tion of your day read­ing other peo­ple’s thoughts, opin­ions, ar­ti­cles, and code snip­pets on blogs all over the web. The rea­son I got into writ­ing code in the ﬁrst place was try­ing to do what some­one else could do.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Look at this guy, he made a cool nav­i­ga­tion menu”.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Hey, this guy built out his own node server”. Building things and com­par­ing your work to that of oth­ers is some­thing that is just go­ing to hap­pen in life, and es­pe­cially in this in­dus­try. I love this. It makes me want to do more stuff. Often, it makes me learn that I want to do things that I had no idea about un­til I saw some­one else do it.</p>\n<p>The same is true for a blog. If step one of learn­ing pro­gram­ming is learn­ing to write code by read­ing what other peo­ple wrote, prob­a­bly one of the more in­ter­me­di­ate steps is ac­tu­ally writ­ing those ideas your­self. It’s an ap­peal­ing thought right? Having got­ten through the gaunt­let of learn­ing what ex­actly a <span class=\"small-caps\">CSS</span> pre­proces­sor is, or how to set up an <span class=\"small-caps\">SSL</span> cert on a new server, or what­ever col­lec­tion of giz­mos and gad­gets you cur­rently have on your ma­chine to build cool things, you now want to be­stow onto oth­ers what you have learned, just as you had when you were in their less ex­pe­ri­enced shoes. Here’s the prob­lem though: <em>set­ting up a blog sucks</em>.</p>\n<p>So every per­son that has ever tried to start up some sort of reg­u­lar writ­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, whether it’s a book, a blog, a se­ries of es­says, what­ever, they will most likely talk about how stick­ing to it can be a chore some times. Writer’s block is some­thing that is com­mon par­lance. So is just be­ing lazy. The act of get­ting your thoughts out there is al­ready a chal­leng­ing one, and will made even more so if you have to ﬁght your tools along the way. I live every day in­side of a code ed­i­tor. I’m used to deal­ing with text. I’m used to hav­ing that text do mag­i­cal things for me, and have some­thing pop out that’s per­fect and func­tional (bugs never hap­pen, shhh). So when I’ve tried to set up blogs in the past, I’ve al­ways got­ten an­noyed at this step:<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Great! I just set up my own site, and now I can add a blog… by set­ting up word­press. Crap, should this be it’s own sub­do­main? It is <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> af­ter all. Hmm… but I want to show the ti­tle of this ar­ti­cle on my home page”. Inspiration to write some­thing cool quickly turns into go­ing through an ex­er­cise in a tech stack that you’re less fa­mil­iar with, or try­ing to think through how this should be set up.</p>\n<p>As I’ve started to work more, I’ve re­ally come to adopt the strat­egy of get­ting as few things as pos­si­ble in the way of me do­ing what I like. I want to do lots of things, quickly, and pretty well, and have them be im­proved later if they need to be im­proved. Having a B+ side pro­ject now is of­ten bet­ter than an A pro­ject in 8 weeks. On top of that, I want to be re­minded of things that I should be do­ing. A com­mon tip gui­tarists give for learn­ing to play gui­tar, is to never put your gui­tar in a case when you’re home. Get a stand, put it in the mid­dle of your liv­ing room. Have it star­ing at you as you walk by. You’ll feel guilty when you don’t pick it up every now and then. If I have a pro­ject called<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>blog” star­ing at me within my code­base, I’ll def­i­nitely no­tice it.</p>\n<p>All this think­ing made me want to make some­thing to make my dumb idea of writ­ing dumb ideas eas­ier for me. ItsABlog is built for the de­vel­op­ers who just want to add some blog posts to their site. I don’t need a data­base. I don’t need user ac­counts. I don’t need all the stuff that a nor­mal <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> comes with. I just need text. I just <em>want</em> text. I live in text, as I’m guess­ing a lot of you do too. I want to write text. I want that to be­come a page on a web­site. I don’t want to have to think much about it. I want it to be source con­trolled like every­thing else I do in my wak­ing life. I want <span class=\"small-caps\">JSON</span>, I know how to deal with that. Sure, maybe there’s a few cool fea­tures I’d want to have here or there, tag­ging cer­tain posts, show­ing when a post was writ­ten. If you agree with any of this, go ahead and take a look at the pro­ject on GitHub. Hopefully it can get your ideas out there a lit­tle bit eas­ier.</p>\n",
